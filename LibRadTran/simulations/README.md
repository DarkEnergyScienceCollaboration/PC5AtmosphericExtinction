## Simulate pure molecular scattering on October 31st 2016:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Do it in pp and ps geometry.


- in simulation : RT/2.0/LS/pp/us/sc
- in simulation : RT/2.0/LS/pp/sw/sc
- in simulation : RT/2.0/LS/ps/us/sc
- in simulation : RT/2.0/LS/ps/sw/sc

## Simulate pure molecular absorption by barying ozone on November 1st 2016:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Do it in pure pp geometry
